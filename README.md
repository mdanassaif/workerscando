# WorkersCanDo

**100 micro-tools in 100 days — all powered by Cloudflare Workers.**

We're building a collection of fast, free, and focused developer tools that run at the edge. Each tool solves one problem really well, and you can learn how it works under the hood.

## What is This?

WorkersCanDo is more than just a tool collection — it's a learning journey. We're exploring what's possible with Cloudflare Workers by building real, useful tools and sharing everything along the way.

Whether you're curious about edge computing, want to learn serverless development, or just need a quick tool that works — you're in the right place.

## The Challenge

**100 tools. 100 days. Zero excuses.**

Every tool we build is:
- ⚡ **Fast** — deployed globally on 300+ edge locations
- 🎯 **Focused** — does one thing and does it well
- 🆓 **Free** — no auth, no limits, just use it
- 📖 **Open** — learn from the code, contribute your ideas

## Live Tools

Here are some tools already live and ready to use:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| **URL Metadata API** | Extract title, description, OG tags from any URL |
| **Dynamic OG Images** | Generate social sharing images on the fly |
| *...and more coming every day* | |

- **Tools Backend**: Cloudflare Workers

## Why Cloudflare Workers?

Workers run your code at the edge — meaning your users get responses from servers close to them, not from one central location. This makes everything faster and opens up new possibilities for what you can build.

We're proving that you can build genuinely useful tools with Workers, and we want to show you how.
